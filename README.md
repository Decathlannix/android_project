  Tetris Klone, as we call it, is an implementation of Tetris using Kotlin, based on the onDraw() method, with a couple of added features just for good measure. In addition to the standard 
  gameplay, the project includes a customizable profile photo and online leaderboards using Firebase, which now, after a couple of years, are understandably down. An alternative control 
  scheme can also be used, tilting the phone to move pieces left and right.
